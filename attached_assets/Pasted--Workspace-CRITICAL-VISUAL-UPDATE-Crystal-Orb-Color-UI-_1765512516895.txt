@Workspace CRITICAL VISUAL UPDATE: Crystal Orb Color & UI Refinement

PROBLEM: Current orb is too bright/jarring. Need to match reference images with deeper, richer tones.

COLOR CORRECTION REQUIRED:

1. REDUCE BRIGHTNESS/SATURATION:
   - Current teal is too electric/bright (#0d9488 at 100% brightness)
   - Target: Deeper, more sophisticated teal with subtle gradients
   - Think: Deep ocean/cosmic crystal, NOT neon sign
   - Add subtle midnight blue and darker teal tones for depth
   - Reference: User wants colors from attached Gemini/ChatGPT examples (rich turquoise transitioning to deep blue-black)

2. GRADIENT IMPROVEMENT:
   - Center: Brighter teal core (but softer than current)
   - Middle: Rich turquoise with subtle blue undertones  
   - Edges: Deep blue-black gradient (NOT pure black)
   - Add subtle opacity variations for glass-like depth

3. REMOVE DISTRACTING TEXT:
   - DELETE the "Your Lil' Helper for Tech & Life" text at bottom
   - Keep ONLY:
     * The crystal orb (center, large, stunning)
     * Very delicate, minimal Login/Signup button (top right corner, subtle, small)
   - The orb should be THE focal point with minimal UI clutter

4. IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SPHERE MOVEMENT:
   From Gemini's detailed instructions - create organic, natural animation:
   
   A. Core Pulse: Central core should slowly breathe (scale up/down 5%) over 8 seconds
   
   B. Ring Flow: The 3 SVG ring layers must rotate at DIFFERENT speeds in DIFFERENT directions:
      - Ring 1: Clockwise, 20 seconds
      - Ring 2: Counter-clockwise, 35 seconds  
      - Ring 3: Clockwise, 50 seconds
   
   C. Fluidity Trick: Apply subtle, slow CSS transform skew to create "wavy" fluid look
   
   D. Avoid robotic feel - use these specific timing curves:
      - Breathing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)
      - Float: ease-in-out with 16s duration
      - Organic heartbeat rhythm for glow layer

5. CSS IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Use CSS variables for dynamic color control:
     :root {
       --orb-hue: 180; /* Adjust from 175 to 180 for deeper tone */
       --orb-saturation: 70%; /* Reduce from 100% to 70% */
       --orb-lightness: 35%; /* Reduce from 50% to 35% for deeper color */
     }
   
   - Apply mix-blend-mode: screen or plus-lighter for glowing rings
   - Use filter: blur() for soft light effect on energy layers
   - Ensure animations use GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)

6. LAYOUT SIMPLIFICATION:
   - Center the orb
   - Remove tagline text
   - Add subtle login/signup link in corner (14px, low opacity, Inter font)
   - Pure black background (#000000)
   - Let the orb breathe with ample whitespace

EXECUTE THESE UPDATES NOW. Priority: Fix jarring colors first, then remove text, then enhance animations.
