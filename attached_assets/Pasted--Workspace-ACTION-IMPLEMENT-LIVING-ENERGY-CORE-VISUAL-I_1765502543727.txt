@Workspace ACTION: IMPLEMENT "LIVING ENERGY CORE" VISUAL INTERFACE

**ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVE:**
We are abandoning static image assets for the main interface orb. Instead, we will build a high-performance, resolution-independent, generative visual component using React, CSS variables, and SVG filters.

**GOAL:**
Create a minimalist, glowing orb with fluid, wispy energy rings that look stunningly crisp on all device DPRs (device pixel ratios) and can dynamically shift color palettes based on UI state.

---

### STEP 1: DEFINE DYNAMIC COLOR INFRASTRUCTURE (CSS globals)

In your global CSS file (e.g., `globals.css`), define the core hue as a variable. This is the "knob" we will turn with Javascript later to change states.

```css
:root {
  /* Default Theme: "Safety Teal" */
  --orb-hue: 175; /* Hue value for teal */
  --orb-saturation: 100%;
  --orb-lightness: 50%;
  
  /* Derived colors - THE AGENT MUST USE THESE */
  --orb-core-color: hsl(var(--orb-hue), var(--orb-saturation), var(--orb-lightness));
  --orb-glow-color: hsla(var(--orb-hue), var(--orb-saturation), 60%, 0.5);
  --orb-ring-color: hsla(var(--orb-hue), 90%, 70%, 0.8);
}

/* Example State Classes (to be toggled by JS) */
.state-thinking {
  --orb-hue: 280; /* Purple */
}

.state-talking {
  --orb-hue: 140; /* Green */
}

.state-offline {
  --orb-hue: 0;
  --orb-saturation: 0%; /* Grayscale */
}
```

### STEP 2: BUILD THE COMPONENT STRUCTURE (`LivingOrb.tsx`)

Create a new component representing the design in the reference image. It needs layers to create depth.

Structure Requirements:
1. Container: A centered div to hold everything.
2. Central Core: A div with a steep radial gradient (bright center to dark edge) using the `--orb-core-color`.
3. Energy Rings (The "Fluid" part):
   - Use 3 separate layers of inline SVGs for the rings.
   - Each SVG should contain a stroked circle or elliptical path.
   - Crucial technique for "wispy" look: Apply heavy CSS `filter: blur()` and `opacity` to these SVG layers so they look like soft light, not hard lines. Use `mix-blend-mode: screen` or `plus-lighter` to make them glow against the black background.

### STEP 3: ORCHESTRATE ORGANIC ANIMATION (Tailwind/CSS)

We need movement that feels natural, not robotic.

Animation Directives:
1. Core Pulse: The central core should slowly breathe (scale up/down 5%) over 8 seconds.
2. Ring Flow: The 3 SVG ring layers must rotate at different speeds and in different directions (e.g., Ring 1 rotates CW in 20s, Ring 2 rotates CCW in 35s, Ring 3 rotates CW in 50s).
3. Fluidity Trick: To get the "wavy" fluid look, apply a subtle, slow CSS transform skew or morphing SVG path animation to the rings while they rotate.

### STEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION & OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

1. Mobile-First Sizing: Ensure the base component size is appropriate for mobile width (e.g., `w-[300px] h-[300px]`) and scales up on desktop breakpoints.
2. Performance: Use only hardware-accelerated CSS properties for animation (`transform: rotate/scale`, `opacity`). DO NOT animate width/height or top/left.
3. Integration: Replace the existing placeholder image on the Landing Page and Senior Dashboard with this new component.
4. Test Color Shifting: Temporarily add buttons to the dev interface to toggle the `.state-thinking` and `.state-talking` classes on a parent element to verify the entire orb smoothly shifts color hue.

EXECUTE.
