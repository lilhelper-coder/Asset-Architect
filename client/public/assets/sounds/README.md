# Thinking Sounds

This directory contains filler audio files that play while waiting for AI responses.

## Files
- `thinking_1.mp3` - Ambient hum (low frequency, calming)
- `thinking_2.mp3` - Soft chime (gentle, non-intrusive)
- `thinking_3.mp3` - Crystal resonance (mystical, short)

## Usage
These sounds are randomly selected and played immediately after speech recognition detects the end of user speech, reducing perceived latency while waiting for the AI response.

## Audio Specifications
- **Duration**: 1-2 seconds
- **Volume**: Low (0.3-0.5)
- **Format**: MP3 (compressed for fast loading)
- **Tone**: Calm, non-alarming, suitable for seniors

## Note
Actual audio files need to be generated/recorded. Placeholder note for now.
For production, use tools like:
- Audacity for recording/editing
- Online tone generators for simple tones
- AI audio generation tools for ambient sounds
